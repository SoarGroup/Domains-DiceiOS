        <p>Liarâ€™s Dice was developed by the Soar research group at the University of Michigan, and uses Soar as the underlying engine for the game AI. Soar is a general cognitive architecture and has been used for developing intelligent agents for training, computer games, and robots. Learn more about Soar at <a href="sitemaker.umich.edu/soar">sitemaker.umich.edu/soar</a>.</p>
		<p>The game AI uses probabilities, heuristics, and even a model of the opponent to determine its bids (but does not include any learning, yet!). Liar's Dice is the first iPhone app powered by Soar.</p>
